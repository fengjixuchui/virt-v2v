Virt-v2v is a program that converts a single guest from a foreign
hypervisor to run on KVM.  It can read Linux and Windows guests
running on VMware, Xen, Hyper-V and some other hypervisors, and
convert them to KVM managed by libvirt, OpenStack, oVirt, Red Hat
Virtualisation (RHV) or several other targets.  It can modify the
guest to make it bootable on KVM and install virtio drivers so it will
run quickly.

There is also a companion front-end called virt-p2v
(https://github.com/libguestfs/virt-p2v) which comes as an ISO, CD or
PXE image that can be booted on physical machines to virtualize those
machines (physical to virtual, or p2v).

Virt-v2v and virt-p2v have been in continuous development since 2007.

For more information about virt-v2v and virt-p2v please read the
respective manual pages.  For virt-v2v, see the docs/ subdirectory in
the source tree.
